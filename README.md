Code for Grespan-Mari's 2018 Incretin Model. The code accompanies the
paper

> E. Grespan, T. Giorgino, A. Natali, E. Ferrannini, A. Mari. *Different mechanisms of GIP
> and GLP-1 action explain their different therapeutic efficacy in type 2 diabetes*. (Preprint)

The code reproduces the paper's figures via Matlab's "publish" feature,
which renders an HTML file with inline comments and figures (tested in Matlab 2015b). The
generated HTML file are in the [html](html) directory and may be previewed
 [here](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/CNR-IN-MatMod/BetaCell2019/blob/master/html/IncretinModel_sim.html).
