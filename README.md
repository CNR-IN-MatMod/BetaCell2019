Code for Grespan-Mari's 2019 Incretin Model. 

The code in this repository accompanies the paper...

> E. Grespan, T. Giorgino, A. Natali, E. Ferrannini, A. Mari. *Different mechanisms of GIP
> and GLP-1 action explain their different therapeutic efficacy in type 2 diabetes*. (Preprint)

This code reproduces the paper's figures via Matlab's "publish" feature,
which renders an HTML file with inline comments and figures (tested in Matlab 2015b). The
rendered HTML and figures are found in the [html](html) directory of the repository. They may be previewed online
 [here](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/CNR-IN-MatMod/BetaCell2019/blob/master/html/IncretinModel_sim.html).
